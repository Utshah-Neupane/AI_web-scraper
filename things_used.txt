To run ollama:
First I had to dowmload and install ollama in my computer and add it to the path
Then I wrote "ollama pull llama3.2:1b" in the command prompt to download the smallest size version of ollama

Now, when I do ollama run llama3.2:1b, I am able to run ollama(ai) locally in my computer cause its freee unlike chatgpt apis
/exit --->this command will take you out of ollama
